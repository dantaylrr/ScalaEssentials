# Functions.

Functions allow us to *abstract over methods*, turning methods into values that we can pass around and manipulate.

Let's look at three methods we wrote that manipulate `IntList`.

```
sealed trait IntList {
    def length: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 0
            case Pair(hd, tl) => 1 + tl.length
        }
    def double: IntList =
        this match {
            case End => End
            case Pair(hd, tl) => Pair(hd * 2, tl.double)
        }
    def product: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 1
            case Pair(hd, tl) hd * tl.product
        }
    def sum: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 0
            case Pair(hd, tl) =? hd + tl.sum
        }
}

case object End extends Intlist
case class Pair(hd: Int, tl: IntList) extends IntList
```

All of these methods have the same general pattern, which is not surprising as they all use structural recursion.

Let's start by focusing on the methods that return an `Int: length`, `product` & `sum`. We want to write a method like:

```
def abstraction(end: Int, f: ???): Int =
    this match {
        case End => end
        case Pair(hd, tl) => f(hd, tl.abstraction(end, f))
    }
```

Where f is an undefined object that does the combination of the head and recursive call for the `Pair` case.

A function is like a method: we can call it with parameters and it evaluates the result. We can pass a function to a method or to another function. We can return a function from a method, and so on.

### Function Types.

We write a function type like (A, B) => C where A & B are the types of the parameters and C is the result type. The same pattern generalises from function of no arguments to an arbitrary number of arguments.

In out example above we want f to be a function that accepts two `Ints` as parameters and returns an `Int`. Thus we can write it as `(Int, Int) => Int`.

**Function type declaration syntax:**

```
(A, B, ...) => C
```
where

* A, B, ... are the types of the input parameters.
* C is the type of the result.

If a function only has one type parameter, the parenthesis may be dropped:
```
A => B
```

### Function literals.

Scala also gives us a *function literal syntax* specifically for creating new functions. Here are a few examples:
```
val sayHi = () => "Hi!"
// sayHi: () => String = <function0>

sayHi()
// res1: String = Hi!

val add1 = (x: Int) => x + 1
// add1: Int => Int = <function1>

add1(10)
// res2: Int = 11

val sum = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
// sum: (Int, Int) => Int = <function2>

sum(10, 20)
// res3: Int = 30
```

**Function literal syntax:**

```
(parameter: type, ...) => expression
```
where - the optional parameters are the names given to the function parameters.
