# Sequencing Computations.

In this section we're going to look at two more language features, *generics* & *functions*, and see some abstractions we can build using these features: *functors* & *montads*.

We will start with the previously defined `IntList`:

```
sealed trait IntList {
    def length: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 0
            case Pair(hd, tl) => 1 + tl.length
        }
    def double: IntList =
        this match {
            case End => End
            case Pair(hd, tl) => Pair(hd * 2, tl.double)
        }
    def product: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 1
            case Pair(hd, tl) => hd * tl.product
        }
    def sum: Int =
        this match {
            case End => 0
            case Pair(hd, tl) => hd + tl.sum
        }
}   
```

There are two problems with this code. The first being that the list is restricted to storing values of type `Int`, secondly, there is a lot of repetition. The code in this example has the same general structure, it would be nice to reduce the amount of duplication.

We'll address both problems in this section. For the first problem we'll use generics to *abstract over types*, so we can use data that works with user defined types. For the second problem we'll use functions to *abstract over methods*.
