# Objects as Functions.

Building on the final exercise from *2.1 Xcercises*, we can define a class called `Adder` as follows.
```
class Adder(amount: Int) {
    def add(in: Int): Int = in + amount
}
```
Adder can be described as an object representing a computation, a bit luke having a method that we can pass around as a value.

This is one of the main concepts driving scala & object-orientated languages, and we call these objects *functions*.

###The apply method.

In scala, by convention, an object can ve "called" like a function if it has a method called `apply`. Naming a method `apply` affords us a special shortened call syntax: `foo.apply(args)` becomes `foo(args)`.

As an example, let's rename the add method from before...
```
class Adder(amount: Int) {
    def apply(in: Int): Int = amount + in
}
```
now
```
val add3 = new Adder(3)
// add3: Adder = Adder@26112a21

add3.apply(4)
// res0: Int = 7

add3(4) // this is shorthand for add3.apply(4)
// res1: Int = 7
```

With this simple trick, objects can syntactically look & behave like a function would. There are lots of things we can do with objects that we can't do with methods, like assign them to variable & pass them around as arguments.
