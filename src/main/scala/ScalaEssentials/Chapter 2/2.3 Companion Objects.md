# Companion Objects.

Sometimes we want to create a method that logically belongs to a class but is independent of any particular object. In scala, these are called *singleton objects*.

A common use case is auxiliary constructors. We can refer to an object as the *companion object* of the same named class. e.g.
```
class Timestamp(val seconds: Long)

object Timestamp {
    def apply(hours: Int, minutes: Int, seconds: Int): Timestamp =
    new Timestamp(hours*60*60 + minutes*60 + seconds)
}

Timestamp(1,1,1).seconds
// res0: Long = 3661
```

**Important Note**: Companion objects are not an instance of the class, they are singleton objects with their own type.

To define a companion object for a class:
```
class Name {
    ...
}

object Name {
    ...
}
```
