# Structural Recursion.

In this section we'll see a pattern for using algebraic data types, know as *structural recursion*. We'll see two variants of this pattern, one using *polymorphism* and the other using *pattern matching*.

Structural recursion is the precise opposite of the process of building an algebraic data type. If A has a B and C (product type), then to construct an A we must have a B & C. Structural recursion states that if we have an A as defined before, we must break it into its constituent B and C that we then combine in some way to get closer to our final answer.

Polymorphism is a typical object-orientated technique, whilst pattern matching is a typical functional technique.

### Structural Recursion using Pattern Matching.

Structural Recursion with pattern matching proceeds along the same lines as polymorphism. We have a case for every subtype, and each pattern matching case must extract the fields we're interested in.

### The Product Type Pattern Matching Pattern.

If A has a b (with type B) and a c (with type C), and we want to write a method f that accepts an A & returns an F:
```
def f(a: A): F =
    a match {
        case A(b, c) => ...
    }
```
In the body of the method we use b & c to construct the type F.

### The Sum Type Pattern Matching Pattern.

If A is a B or C, and we want to write a method f for accepting an A and returning an F, define a pattern matching case for B & C.
