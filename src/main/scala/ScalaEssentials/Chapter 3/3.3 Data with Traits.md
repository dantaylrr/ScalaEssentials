# Modelling data with traits.

In this dection we're going to look at modelling data models in scala defined in terms of *logical ors and ands*. Using the terminology of object-orientated programming, we will express *is-a* and *has-a* relationships. We will be learning about *sum* & *product* types, which are together called *alegebraic data types*.

### Product type pattern.

Our first pattern is to model data that contains other data. e.g. a `Cat` has a colour & a favourite food.

If A has a b (with type B) and a c (with type C), we can write:
```
case class A(b: B, c: C)
```
or
```
trait A {
    def b: B
    def c: C
}
```

### Sum type pattern.

If A is a B or C, we can write:
```
sealed trait A
final case class B() extends A
final case class C() extends A
```

We can now build a little table for the *and*, *or*, *is-a* and *has-a* pattern types...

|   | **And**  | **Or**  |
|---|---|---|
| **Is-a**  |   | Sum Type  |
| **Has-a**  | Product Type  |   |

*What about the missing two patterns?*

### "Is-a and" pattern type.

This pattern type suggests A is a B and C. We can implement it as below:
```
trait B
trait C
trait A extends B with C
```
In scala a trait can extend as many traits as we'd like using the `with` keyword as in the example above. This is know as a **cake pattern**.

### "Has-a or" pattern type.

This pattern type suggests that A has a B or C. There are two ways that we can implement this, we can say A has a d of type D, where D is a B or C, we can mechanically apply our two patterns to implement this...
```
trait A {
    def d: D
}
sealed trait D
final case class B() extends D
final case class c() extends D
```
Alternatively, we could implement this as A is a D or E, and D has a B, and E has a C...
```
trait A
final case class D(b: B) extends A
final case class E(c: C) extends A
```
