# Sealed Traits

In many cases we can enumerate all possible classes that extend a trait. \
i.e. we previously modelled a website visitor as `Anonymous` or a logged in `User`. These two cases cover all the possibilities as one is the negation of the other.
We can model this case as a *sealed trait*, allowing the compiler to provide extra checks for us.

We create a sealed trait by simply writing `sealed` in front of our trait declaration:
```
import java.util.Date

sealed trait Visitor {
    def id: String
    def createdAt: Date
    def age: Long = new Date().getTime() - createdAt.getTime()
}
```
Once a trait is sealed, the compiler knows the compiler knows the complete set of subtypes and will warn us if a pattern matching expression is missing a case.

Furthermore, we can also disallow any extensions to subtypes by using the keyword `final` in front of our `case class`'s.

The syntax for a sealed trait & a final case class are as follows:
```
sealed trait traitName {
    ...
}

final case class Name(...) extends traitName {
    ...
}
```
