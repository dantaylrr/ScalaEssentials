# Object Literals.

In this section we will see how to create objects of our own design using *object literals*.
When we write an object literal we use a *declaration*, which is a different kind of program to an expression.

**A declaration does not evaluate to a value. Instead it associates a name with a value**. This name can then be used to refer to the value in other code.

Declare an empty object:
```
object Test {}
```

This is not an expression - it does not evaluate to a value. Rather it binds the name "Test" to a value (in this case an empty object).

### Methods.

We interact with objects via methods (functions) using the `def` syntax:

```
object Test2 {
    def name: String = "Probably the best object ever"
}
```
Here, we've created a method called name. Calling it...
```
Test2.name
// res0: String = Probably the best object ever
```
Don't forget, with methods we can define input parameters too...
```
object Test3{
    def hello(name: String) = 
        "Hello " + name
}
```
Again, let's call it with an input...
```
Test.hello("Dan")
// res1: String = Hello Dan
```

**Important syntax for defining a method**:

```
def name(parameter: type,...): resultType = bodyExpression
```

### Fields.

An object can also contain other objects, called *fields*. We introduce these using the keywords `val` or `var`... 

`val` fields are *immutable* - they are initialised once, after which we cannot change their values. `var` fields are *mutable* - they can take different types & values.

```
object Test4 {
val name = "Dan"
def hello(other: String): String =
name + " Says hi to " + other
}
```
And let's call it...
```
Test4.hello("Matt")
// res3: String = Dan says hi to Matt
```

**Important syntax for defining a field**:
```
val name: type = valueExpression
var name: type = valueExpression
```
