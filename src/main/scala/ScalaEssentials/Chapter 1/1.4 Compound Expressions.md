# Compound Expressions.

In this book, we look at two special kinds of expressions, *conditionals* & *blocks*.

### Conditionals.

A conditional allows us to choose an expressions to evaluate based on some or any conditions. \
i.e.
```
if(1 < 2) "Yes" else "No
// res0: String = Yes
```

The syntax for a conditional `if` statement is as follows:
```
if(condition)
    trueExpression
else
    falseExpression
```

### Blocks.

Blocks are expressions that allow us to sequence computations together.They are written as a pair of braces containing sub-expressions seperated by semi-colons or new lines.

We can also use a block when we want to name intermediate results, such as...

```
def name: String = {
    val title = "Professor"
    val name = "Funkenstein"
    title + " " + name
}
```
And calling our method...
```
name
// res1: String = Professor Funkenstein
```

The syntax for a block expressions is as follows:
```
{
    declarationOrExpression
    expression
}
```
where `expression` determines the type & value of the block expression.
